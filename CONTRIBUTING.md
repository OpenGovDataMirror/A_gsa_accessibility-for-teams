## Report an error or bug

See something amiss? A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

- Glance through the [existing issues](https://github.com/gsa/accessibility-for-teams/issues) to see if someone has already alerted us to your question or concern *before* filing a new issue.
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/GSA/accessibility-for-teams/issues) and write a detailed description of the problem.
- Include reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
- Provide project, browser, OS, and platform versions.
- Include what you expect the outcome to be.

All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Request a feature

Got a better solution in mind? Fantastic, we'd love to hear about it. 

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/GSA/accessibility-for-teams/issues).
- Ensure your idea: 
  - Fits with the [scope and aims of the project](README.md)
  - Is limited in scope
  - Has a demonstrable user need
  - Understands we focus on the issues most likely to impact government sites. These guidelines do not provide a comprehensive list of all possible issues.

## Email us 

Whether you've got a general question about the Accessibility for Teams, or you'd just like to have a conversation outside of GitHub — whatever the reason, feel free to [email us](mailto:g-accessibility@gsa.gov).

## Project setup

See [Running the site](README.md/#running-the-site).

### Submit a pull request

Got a better solution in mind? Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before starting any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project team might not want to merge into the project. See [Request a feature](#Request-a-feature) to make sure your pull request meets these guidelines.

Here are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request:

1. Glance through [our existing pull requests](https://github.com/gsa/accessibility-for-teams/pulls) to see if we're already working on a similar idea *before* submitting a pull request.
1. Create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account.
1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo here on GitHub:
[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
1. Create a branch from `master` that clearly defines what you’re working on (for example, `fix-menu-bug`).
    * [Set up the project](#project-setup).
    * Make any necessary changes to the source code.
    * Include any additional documentation the changes might need.
    * Write clear, concise commit message(s).
1. Once you’re ready to submit a pull request, [open a pull request](https://github.com/GSA/accessibility-for-teams/pulls).
    * If your PR is connected to an open issue, add a line in your PR's description that says `Fixes: #123`, where `#123` is the number of the issue you're fixing.
1. Submit your pull request against the `main` branch.

Once you've filed the PR:

* One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review.
* If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's OK! We appreciate you taking the time to do it and don't take that lightly. 💚
* If your PR gets accepted, it will be approved and merged into the `main` branch. Your contribution will be published to the site.
